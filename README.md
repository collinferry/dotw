Day One <- Twitter

The dotw.bash script allows you to suck Twitter posts into your Day One journal.

This tool is Specifically written to be run on a Mac via a bash shell; but you may run it on a Windows host if you install a tool like mobaXterm.

NOTE! This tool is designed to import the Date and Text of your post only. More may come in the future; but this is the meat of this project for now.

Before you run the script, you will need to download your Twitter posts.

Log in to your Twitter account.
Click on your avatar in the top right, and click Settings.
Scroll down to the Content section, and follow the instructions to create a Twitter archive.
Download the .zip file from Twitter, and unzip it into a folder called "dotw" in your home directory (i.e. /Users/kitykity/dotw).
